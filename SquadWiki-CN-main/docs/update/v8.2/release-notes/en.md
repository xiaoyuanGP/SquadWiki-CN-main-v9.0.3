Added REDFOR Alliance (RGF and VDV) battlegroups as voting options for all Sanxian Islands layers.
Adjusted Seed Game Mode to limit the following deployables to a max of 5 per FOB: Sandbag Wall + Firing Port, Ammobox, Hesco Wall, Oil Barrel Wall, Dirt Crate Wall + Firing Ports.
Adjusted Seed Game Mode to remove the IMF deployables: Camo Nettings, Hull Down, Observation Tower, and Hedge Hog Tank Trap.
Adjusted the number of tickets gained when capturing a flag on invasion from 130 to 125.
Completed standardization of Invasion layers:

All invasion layers will now have 5 flag layouts.
The first 2-3 objectives are generally closer together to reduce instances where attackers need to maneuver the entire team and set up new FOBs to attack the next point unless it's across more open terrain. Also attempted to reduce instances where areas of thick concealment or urban areas lie between the first flags, which generally bog down attackers and cost them high amounts of tickets to clear. The 4th and 5th objectives will generally be more challenging to attack.
Most invasion layers will no longer have forward vehicle spawns for defenders and will only have infantry spawns closer to the first objective.
Some invasion layers will now have multiple potential lanes to increase replayability.
‍

Gunplay Adjustments
We have made some changes to Squad’s gunplay with the following goals in mind:

Make weapons feel more responsive overall.
Reduce punishment in the form of weapon destabilization that players receive after movement.
Create more standardized weapon archetypes, which will lead to distinct playstyles for players to master.
Improve the effectiveness of machine guns when not bipoded.
Improve the control of sub machineguns at short distances making them more ideal for close quarters and flanking.
‍Medium Machineguns (M240 family, PK family, MG3, QJY-88)‍

Reworked M240 family recoil & sway to be more controllable, particularly in prone and bipod stances.
Standardized hipfire to be more controllable than it was previously.
Standardized ADS move speed, equip movement speed, and reload movement speed to be 40% of normal movement speed.
Standardized per-stance ADS times to be between 0.3 to 0.75 seconds depending on stance and optic. Bipod ADS time is always 0.3 seconds.
Slightly increased the amount of suppression that medium machine guns can output.
Standardized the time it takes to stabilize weapons to be faster than it was previously, but will now be very slow compared to other weapon types.
Increased the time it takes before the weapon is automatically put into the 'lowered' position from 0.15 to 30 seconds.
‍Light Machineguns (M249 family, RPD)‍

Improved MOA on M249 family from 12 to 6.
Standardized Hipfire to be more controllable.
Standardized ADS move speed, equip movement speed, and reload movement speed to be 40% to 50% of normal movement speed depending on optic.
Standardized per-stance ADS times to be between 0.3 to 0.55 seconds depending on stance and optic. Bipod ADS time is always 0.3 seconds.

Standardized ADS move speed, equip movement speed, and reload movement speed to be 50% to 60% of normal movement speed depending on optic.
Standardized per-stance ADS times to be between 0.3 to 0.55 seconds depending on stance and optic. Bipod ADS time is always 0.3 seconds.
The time it takes to stabilize a weapon has been standardized to be faster than it was previously. It will now be faster than machine guns but slower than rifles.
Slightly reduced the damage on the G3 damage curve, now that these weapons are easier to control, they will less frequently cause one-hit kills but still cause high damage that will require immediate bandaging to survive.
Battle rifles with foregrips now provide a small benefit to control recoil.
‍Automatic Rifles (M27 IAR, RPK family, G3A3 w/ drum, QJB95-1)‍

Friends List
We have added a friends list to the Squad main menu. This should make joining your friends’ servers easier. This is our first iteration of this feature, and we expect to see it grow into something more in the future!

Updated WPMC Loach Helicopters to use new "Scout" and "Light CAS" map icons, which more accurately depict their vehicle roles.
Admin's can now cycle between different local voice chat modes:
Hear only friendlies. Only heard by friendlies.
Hear everyone. Only heard by friendlies. (New Default)
Hear everyone. Heard by everyone.
Hear everyone. Only heard by enemies.
